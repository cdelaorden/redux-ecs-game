# React + Redux + Immutable starter kit with webpack and hot reload
What a mouthful for a title, isn't it? :)

Just a quick starter-kit to start up a new project with React and Redux and all required goodies to be a trendy JS developer.

## Usage
Copy or clone everything in this repo. You only have a React component in `./src/containers/app` mounted to check everything works fine.

HTML template and eventually production bundle located at `./dist`

## Tasks
- `npm start` to launch your dev server with hot reloading at `localhost:3000`
- `npm run build` to generate your bundle for production

Happy reducing!
